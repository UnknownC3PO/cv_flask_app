                              It is located behind the back of the nose. It makes hormones that affect many other glands and many functions in your body. 
                              Most pituitary tumors are not cancerous (benign). They donâ€™t spread to other parts of your body.
                              But they can cause the pituitary to make too few or too many hormones, causing problems in the body.''',

                              Symptoms depend on the location and occur as a result of the tumor pressing on nearby tissue. 
                              Many cases never produce symptoms. 
                              Occasionally seizures, dementia, trouble talking, vision problems, one sided weakness, or loss of bladder control may occur.''',
